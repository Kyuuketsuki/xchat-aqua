Known Bugs - Any help fixing them is greatly appreciated!

1. Mouseover doesn't work under certain circumstances

    Steps to reproduce:
    1. Go into recording mode
    2. Hold mouse over the snapback area
    3. Type keycombo OR hit escape/delete

    Expected behavior: Remove badge will be highlighted

    Observed behavior: Mouse is over the remove badge but the badge is not 
    highlighted. Moving the mouse outside and inside again will highlight 
    the badge.

        => When a keycombo is already set and the snapback badge is clicked, 
           the badge is highlighted correctly!

        => Reason: The event generated immediately after performKeyEquivalent
                   in ShortcutRecorderCell's resetTrackingRects method (NSPoint
                   mouseLocation...) contains a stupid mouseLocation! Dunno...

2. On e.g. a german system, the accent "^" won't be shown (but can be typed with the shift modifier since [theEvent charactersIgnoringModifiers] returns "¡" (bug?). Mapping the keyCode (10) doesn't work since it's keyboard layout dependent (german ^, english ¤).

3. Like 2., just for "«" and "`" (also on non-english systems).

4. Doesn't seem to work in NSMatrix right now.

5. The Key-View loop gets screwed when you make the control the first responder.  It is not possible to tab out of it for example.

6. Focus ring draws incorrectly: Go into recording mode, type any shortcut, move the mouse a few times over the delete badge. you'll notive the focus ring to be drawn again and again, looking very strange.

7. Space key to enter recording mode issue: open the demo app, tab to any checkbox, hit space once: first misbehaior: the lower SRRecorder goes into recording mode, hit space again, the top recorder goes into recording mode. Hitting ESC twice, will go out of the recording mode of both controls and set the keyboard focus to the lower control.
